# Reworked enemy ideas

Key tenets:
- Massively scaled-down health, aiming for Paper Mario levels of scaling
- Multi-target fights are the norm (targeting prioritization is fun, emergent complexity from enemy combinations is fun)
- Core gameplay unit is a "quest": 3-6 battles in sequence without (or with very limited) opportunities to recover or heal between combat
- Fundamental stats of enemies are:
  - health: reduce to 0 to defeat
  - defense: flat reduction on damage taken, comparable to "soak" in some RPGs
  - actions: things the enemy can do. Have their own special characteristics:
    - damage: damage dealt by each hit performed by the enemy
    - number of hits: number of hits - scales effect of increased damage and target's defense multiplicatively. Use with a light touch, or clearly telegraph.
    - auxiliary effects: buffs, debuffs, or other statuses applied by an action.
